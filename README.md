# The New Civilisation [![Team Futuriste][cult-img]][cult]

The New Civilisation provides you a platform to earn credits when you move in the direction
of sustainable development. We call this decentralised currency as carbon credits. If you are
the reason for 1 tonne for CO2 emission, your carbon credit will be reduced by unity, and
increased by one tonne if you move towards sustainability.

How can you reduce carbon emission :

- **Buy Sustainable Clothing** , and earn carbon credits.
- Follow **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle** principal, donate your unused item to the
  regulating authority and Carbon Credits.
- **Cycle today and leave your Car** because your CO2 tracker will reduce your
  earned Credits.
- Donate to **charities and global well-being**, earn credits and share it to the underprivileged.
- Earned your credits? **Now exhange them for your global currency!**
